# guacamole-python

This is just an example that I put together at one point for someone
on the mailing list to demonstrate how to interact with the Guacamole Client
REST API with a Python script.  There are a few useful things that can
be done with the script - as I get time and the inclination I'll try to
add functions and build it out a little more.  Meanwhile, feel free to
fork, use, or submit pull requests for the code if you like it or want
to help with it.
